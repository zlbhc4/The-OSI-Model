# Layer 3 — The Network Layer

**Purpose:**  
The Network Layer handles **routing**, making sure that data can travel between networks using logical addressing.

---

## What Happens at This Layer?
- Creates and manages **IP packets**
- Provides **logical addressing** (IPv4 & IPv6)
- Determines the **best path** using routing protocols  
- Supports packet fragmentation and reassembly

---

## Real-World Examples
- Routers
- IPv4 / IPv6
- Routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, RIP)
- ICMP (used for ping)

---

## Summary
Layer 3 makes sure data can move **between different networks**, not just within any one single local connection.
