# Layer 1 — The Physical Layer

**Purpose:**  
The Physical Layer is responsible for **transmitting raw bits** over a physical medium—electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves.

---

## What Happens at This Layer?
- Converts binary data (1s and 0s) into physical signals  
- Defines connectors, pinouts, cable types, frequencies  
- Handles bit timing and synchronization  
- Establishes/terminates the physical connection  

---

## Real-World Examples
- Ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6, Cat7)
- Fiber optic cables
- Wi-Fi radio frequencies
- Hubs and repeaters
- Bluetooth radio signals  

---

## Summary
Layer 1 handles the **actual transmission medium**. It does not understand frames, packets, or addressing—it simply moves signals.
