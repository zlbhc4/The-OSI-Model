# Layer 2 — The Data Link Layer

**Purpose:**  
The Data Link Layer is responsible for **node-to-node communication** and makes sure that data is delivered reliably over the physical medium.

---

## What Happens at This Layer?
- Packages raw bits into **frames**
- Handles **MAC addresses**
- Performs **error detection and correction**
- Controls access to the physical medium (e.g., CSMA/CD)

---

## Real-World Examples
- Switches
- Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- Ethernet (802.3)
- Wi-Fi MAC layer (802.11)
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

---

## Summary
Layer 2 makes communication more reliable by framing the data and managing the MAC addresses. It operates directly above the physical medium in the first layer.
