# Layer 4 — The Transport Layer

**Purpose:**  
The Transport Layer provides **end-to-end data delivery**, making sure that all information arrives completely and in the correct order.

---

## What Happens at This Layer?
- Splits data into **segments** (TCP) or **datagrams** (UDP)
- Provides **reliable delivery** (TCP)
- Performs **flow control** and **error recovery**
- Manages **port numbers** for applications

---

## Real-World Examples
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- TLS (operates between layers 4 & 5 in some models)

---

## Summary
Layer 4 controls how data is sent between hosts and how errors are handled, with TCP offering more reliability and UDP offering more speed.
