## Summary
This is a tutorial that introduces the **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model**, which is a seven-layer framework that is used to help understand how data can travel across computer networks. The goal of this tutorial is to provide a basic understanding of these layers and how they interact, as well as give examples of real devices and uses for this model.
