# Layer 6 — The Presentation Layer

**Purpose:**  
The Presentation Layer is responsible for **data translation, encryption, and compression** so that systems can correctly decode information.

---

## What Happens at This Layer?
- Converts data between formats (e.g., JSON, XML)
- Compresses data to reduce size
- Encrypts and decrypts data
- Ensures that the receiving system can understand the data from its source

---

## Real-World Examples
- SSL/TLS encryption (often implemented here conceptually)
- JPEG, MP3, PNG formats
- Character encoding (ASCII, UTF-8)

---

## Summary
Layer 6 prepares data so it’s **presentable and understandable**, regardless of any system differences.
